# MAMBA
This project was DIFFICULT to work on.
It is a dedication to Kobe Bryant; and his 13 year old daughter, Gianna.
Kobe was one of my greatest inspiration since I was a young child. He always gave 2000% in everything he did.
He was bigger than basketball.
I always wanted to own a art school because I am deeply rooted into the arts (dance/photgraphy/music/painting);
so this project allowed me to create a website for a dream school, which I said was founded by Kobe in 2018 (retirement year);
That is why I named the school, MAMBA SCHOOL OF ARTS.
